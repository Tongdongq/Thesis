Possible questions during defence:

What is the theorical max speedup of Darwin?
- occupancy of functional units is 45%
What is the bottleneck for Darwin on GPU?
- registers, memory latency
- fine-grained parallelism might be better
How easy is it to adapt Darwin to work on protein?
- packing from GASAL uses 4 bit per symbol, max 16 different values
- there are ~22 different aminoacids, Blosum can be put in constant memory
What portion of total assembly time is spent on alignment?
Can this be used for reference based alignment?
- yes
Why are only 63% of the tiles 320x320 in Darwin?
- take the average read length, how many overlapping tiles can fit in there?
- don't forget not all traceback paths go to the corner
Why not use DOPA?
- DOPA does not have traceback, this is essential to the GACT algorithm
- GASAL has a simpler implementation, which is easy to add traceback to

To be answered in thesis:
How are the sensitivity and specificity measured?
How are the sensitivity and specificity influenced by the parameters?
How does the error rate of the reads impact those metrics?
How suitable are Oxford Nanopore reads for Darwin/Daligner?
How do the aligners create the large list of LA/GACT_calls?
- daligner creates an LAcall for every Kmer would be part of a seed
