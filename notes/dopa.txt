Notes on Dopa, Marijns thesis and the code from ACS lab 3

sequences are coalesced by half-warp,
sequences are padded to the longest sequence in the half-warp with blank symbols

query is put in constant memory, each thread reads the same address

substitution matrix was put in shared memory, but gave a slowdown due to bank conflicts, it is now put in texture memory, which is well suited to random access
