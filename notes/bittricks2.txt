Idea: represent matches/mismatches with 1/0 in matrix, try to compute alignment from there.
Matrices are still very large, but multiple threads could work on the same readpair.

If bases are compressed, 16 fit in 1 int (see 'bittricks.txt').

Maybe create multiple tracks with the same read, but different alignment:

0
A T G G T C
x A T G G T C
x x A T G G T C
x x x A T G G T C

To prevent extra shifting and masking when comparing.

The match/mismatch vector could be stored diagonally, so that 1 thread can immediately see the snake.


  A T G G T C
A 0 1 1 1 1 1
A 0 1 1 1 1 1
T 1 0 1 1 0 1
G 1 1 0 0 1 1
C 1 1 1 1 1 0
A 0 1 1 1 1 1 

0
A A T G C A
1
A T G G T C
x A T G G T C
x x A T G G T C
x x x A T G G T C

T0:
A A T G C A
A T G G T C
-----------
0 1 1 0 1 1 -> snake = 1

T1:
A A T G C A
x A T G G T
-----------
x 0 0 0 1 1 -> snake = 3
